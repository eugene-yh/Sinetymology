## Academic hypotheses
### Claims
1. [Masini, 1993]

        A chinese autochthon with earliest appearance in 《史记》 meaning trade. It should not be considered as a loan from Japanese.

2. [Miller, 1967]

        An original loan from Japanese (貿易·bōeki).

### Evidence in literatures and other materials
1. Chinese occurences

        史記‐貨殖伝・范蠡「以物相貿易」
        
2. Japanese occurences

        律〔７１８〕賊盗・貿易条「凡以私財物・奴婢・畜産之類、〈略〉貿易官物者、計其等、准盗論」
        類聚三代格‐一八・天長五年〔８２８〕正月二日・太政官符「蕃客物私交者、法有恒科、而此間之人必愛遠物、争以貿易」
        正法眼蔵〔１２３１～５３〕袈裟功徳「あるいは浄命よりうるところのものをもて、市にして貿易せらん、またこれ袈裟につくりつべし」
        
3. Japanese etymologies
    - 日本国語大辞典
        
        Both 交易 and 貿易 had been used in the middle ages in the meaning of trade with 交易 as a more predominant choice.
        However, since Meiji era, 貿易 began to be used more.


## Sinetymology's Opinion

    We want to add on top of the claim of [Masini, 1993] that 贸易 have shifted from a verb
    to a noun in Mainland Mandarin. The equivalent of the verb usage may be 进行贸易.
