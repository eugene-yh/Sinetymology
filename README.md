# Sinetymology
This is an open database project aiming to make the etymologies of modern Mandarin Chinese Lexicon publically available. 
By etymologies of modern Chinese Lexicon, we mean:
1. the origins and evolution of words one can find in modern Chinese texts. 
2. and **NOT** the structure, analysis, and evolution of chinese characters.

Chinese languages, such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, etc., have a ideographic character-based script. Although each character has its own semantics and evolution history, it is not always an idiosyncratic word, which is especially the case for modern Chinese languages. Therefore, to stick to the the defintion of etymology (i.e., history of words), we decide to initiate this project that solely concerns origins and evolution of Chinese words because there is no currently freely available collected contents about them online.

Anyone can contribute to this project as long as credited literature and reliable materials are provided.
